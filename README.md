# Music

This application is a project that I created while taking the Zero To Mastery (ZTM) course, Complete Vue Developer 2022. I built this application using Vue.JS, Pinia as state management, Vue Router, Vee Validate for form validation, Vue i18n for for translation purposes, Firebase for storage, and Vitest for testing. After registering, you can upload, edit and delete your favorite songs and you can listen to them right away. You can also write comments for existing songs.
